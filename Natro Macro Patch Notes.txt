0.5.1 Patch Notes

New Features
-Added Honey Bee Quest!!
-Added King Beetle!!

Bugs
-Corrected hourly report interval from 5 minutes back to 1 hour in webhook.
-Another attempt to fix micro-converters so it will not return you to hive immediately after used.

Other
-Increased backpack conversion time limit from 3 minutes to 5 minutes.  It was causing some players to not completely empty backpack before timing out.
-Decreased quest gathering time limit from 30 minutes to 5 minutes.  This was causing issues if you drifted out of the field and would never "complete" gathering in the field you were supposed to be in for a full 30 minutes before timing out.
-Added an option to quests to allow bug timers to interrupt gathering.  Previously quest bug timers would always interrupt gathering.  Not allowing this will increase your gathered honey but will slow down how quickly the quests are completed.
-Added an option to interrupt gathering for Bug Runs for those that want to prioritize killing bugs over gathering honey.
-Added a "Stationary" gathering pattern for those that dont want to move at all and just gather without moving.
-Bug Kills while gathering, searching, or while fighting Vicious Bee are now detected and tracked.  This will reduce wasted time in bugruns if the bug was already killed otherwise.


0.5.0 Patch Notes

New Features
-Added Webhooks!! Special thanks to xSPx, Scripting_Noob, and Zaappiix for developing this nice feature.  This feature is still a work in progress and it will likely be a little out of sync with the Noob edition.

Bugs
-Adjusted hive camera rotation ordering.
-Corrected an slowness issue that was introduced in the previous patch.
-Checking for nighttime will now only occur if the Stingers option is selected.  This was causing trouble for gathering patterns.
-Fixed an error in the Planters+ nectar measurement where a 100% full nectar was counted as 0%.  This would cause Planters+ to keep re-planting for that nectar indefinately.
-Fixed an issue where after using a micro-converter you would return to hive anyway.
-Fixed an issue where if you die while gathering pollen for a quest, you will reset and try again.
-Fixed an issue where a full backpack would cause a reset rather than return to hive.

Other
-Pause (F2) will no longer do anything if the macro has not previously been started (F1).


0.4.1 Patch Notes

Bugs
-Fixed an issue causing character to stand in place for a while doing nothing.
-Fixed an issue causing balloon conversions to abort too early and in some cases causing blessing to be lost.
-Fixed an issue where fields 2 and 3 were not gathered.
-Fixed pathing for Vicious Bee check in Pepper
-Fixed a pathing issue when placing diamond sprinklers.

New Features
-Added ability to customize distance for field sprinkler start locations.

Other
-Changed how Planters+ measures nectar percentages.  It is much faster and more accurate than before.
