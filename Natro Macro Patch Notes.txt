0.5.0 Patch Notes

New Features
-Added Webhooks!! Special thanks to xSPx and Scripting_Noob for developing this nice feature.  This feature is still a work in progress and it will likely be a little out of sync with the Noob edition.

Bugs
-Adjusted hive camera rotation ordering.
-Corrected an slowness issue that was introduced in the previous patch.
-Checking for nighttime will now only occur if the Stingers option is selected.  This was causing trouble for gathering patterns.
-Fixed an error in the Planters+ nectar measurement where a 100% full nectar was counted as 0%.  This would cause Planters+ to keep re-planting for that nectar indefinately.
-Fixed an issue where after using a micro-converter you would return to hive anyway.
-Fixed an issue where if you die while gathering pollen for a quest, you will reset and try again.
-Fixed an issue where a full backpack would cause a reset rather than return to hive.

Other
-Pause (F2) will no longer do anything if the macro has not previously been started (F1).
