0.6.1 Patch Notes

New Features
-Added new "Auryn" gathering pattern.  Shaped like my discord pfp.

Other
-The Ant Challenge objective for quests will bypass the normal 2 hour timeout as long as you have ant passes and the quest objective is not yet complete.  If not, it will do them every 2 hours whenever you get a free ant pass.
-Riley & Bucko quests steps that collect tokens will now use your Gather Field1 selections to gather the tokens somewhat passively.  Previously it would have you go to a respective red or blue field instead.
-Riley "Rampage" quest will now do bugruns for rage tokens rather than just collect in Strawberry until complete.
-Adjusted pathing to Blue field booster to be more reliable.
-Adjusted pathing to Glue dispenser to be more reliable.
-Upon a disconnect the Roblox window will be maximized when restarted.

Bugs
-I accidently included settings for my alt in the last release for Black Bear Quests.  The blue/red collection field selections were sub-optimal.
-Fixed issue where bug cooldown gather interruptions were not working properly for quests.
-Fixed issue where if not all of the quest steps were visible in the log you would not return to the questgiver even if the quest was complete.
-Fixed and issue causing an error in the webhook send commands for some people. (it is recommended to make sure your windows installation is up to date)
-Fixed issue where you would go back to check for King Beetle even after it was killed.
-Fixed an issue where gifted vicious hive bonus was causing excessive tunnel bear checks.
-Fixed an issue where automatic microconverters were preventing the return to hive if they are all used up and the backpack was full.


0.6.0 Patch Notes

New Features
-Added Ant Challenge
-Added Bucko Quests
-Added Riley Quests

Bugs
-Adjusted the Ant Pass flight path.  It was very inconsistent.

Other
-Adjusted some of the default field settings.


0.5.2 Patch Notes

New Features
-Added Black Bear Quest
-Added a "Gather in Boosted Field" option in the Boost tab.  If enabled, this will check to see if you have any field boosts and gather there instead.  If more than one field is boosted, the selection process will bias to the highest level field in the following order: Blue->White->Red. Note that this feature is mutually exclusive with Automatic Field Boost so they cannot be used at the same time.

Bugs
-Corrected various issues related to Honey Bee Quest management.
-Corrected various issues related to Tunnel Bear and King Beetle.
-Fixed and issue where CurrentField was not updated to a valid field if it was the current gathering field and then changed to "None" in the GUI.
-Auto Field Boost will now stop trying to roll dice if a disconnect occurs.

Other
-"Easy Mode" is now even easier!
-Webhook feature is no longer allowed unless using Windows 10 or higher.
-Killing bugs now looks for death messages instead of just being a flat timer.  This should make bugruns slightly faster.
-Added some "Interrupted" status messages for when your gathering is ended pre-maturely.
-Minor adjustment to the glue dispenser pathing to make it more reliable.
-Minor adjustment to the blueberry dispenser pathing to make it more reliable.
-Minor adjustment to the ant pass dispenser pathing to make it more reliable.
-Minor adjustment to locating hive slot after a disconnect.
-Added separate and different field default settings for each field.  The idea is to have a default that will minimize field drift.  These settings may need adjustment since I have not extensively tested all possible combinations for every field.
-Stingers/Vicious Bee will now interrupt a bug-run.


0.5.1 Patch Notes

New Features
-Added Honey Bee Quest!!
-Added King Beetle!!

Bugs
-Corrected hourly report interval from 5 minutes back to 1 hour in webhook.
-Another attempt to fix micro-converters so it will not return you to hive immediately after used.

Other
-Increased backpack conversion time limit from 3 minutes to 5 minutes.  It was causing some players to not completely empty backpack before timing out.
-Decreased quest gathering time limit from 30 minutes to 5 minutes.  This was causing issues if you drifted out of the field and would never "complete" gathering in the field you were supposed to be in for a full 30 minutes before timing out.
-Added an option to quests to allow bug timers to interrupt gathering.  Previously quest bug timers would always interrupt gathering.  Not allowing this will increase your gathered honey but will slow down how quickly the quests are completed.
-Added an option to interrupt gathering for Bug Runs for those that want to prioritize killing bugs over gathering honey.
-Added a "Stationary" gathering pattern for those that dont want to move at all and just gather without moving.
-Bug Kills while gathering, searching, or while fighting Vicious Bee are now detected and tracked.  This will reduce wasted time in bugruns if the bug was already killed otherwise.


0.5.0 Patch Notes

New Features
-Added Webhooks!! Special thanks to xSPx, Scripting_Noob, and Zaappiix for developing this nice feature.  This feature is still a work in progress and it will likely be a little out of sync with the Noob edition.

Bugs
-Adjusted hive camera rotation ordering.
-Corrected an slowness issue that was introduced in the previous patch.
-Checking for nighttime will now only occur if the Stingers option is selected.  This was causing trouble for gathering patterns.
-Fixed an error in the Planters+ nectar measurement where a 100% full nectar was counted as 0%.  This would cause Planters+ to keep re-planting for that nectar indefinately.
-Fixed an issue where after using a micro-converter you would return to hive anyway.
-Fixed an issue where if you die while gathering pollen for a quest, you will reset and try again.
-Fixed an issue where a full backpack would cause a reset rather than return to hive.

Other
-Pause (F2) will no longer do anything if the macro has not previously been started (F1).


0.4.1 Patch Notes

Bugs
-Fixed an issue causing character to stand in place for a while doing nothing.
-Fixed an issue causing balloon conversions to abort too early and in some cases causing blessing to be lost.
-Fixed an issue where fields 2 and 3 were not gathered.
-Fixed pathing for Vicious Bee check in Pepper
-Fixed a pathing issue when placing diamond sprinklers.

New Features
-Added ability to customize distance for field sprinkler start locations.

Other
-Changed how Planters+ measures nectar percentages.  It is much faster and more accurate than before.
